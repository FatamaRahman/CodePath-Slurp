# CodePath Group Project - SLURP!

## User Stories
SLURP! is a food taste profile app. It connects you to users with similar taste profiles, allows you to check in at restaurants, and create stats based upon your food profile. 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User will be able to log in and log out.
- [ ] Profile page:
   - [ ] Contains the user header view
   - [ ] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # check ins, last check, and food stats.
- [ ] Newsfeed: Shows user the hottest food places in your area where the most people have checked in, and also where the most people with your food taste have checked in. 
- [ ] Newsfeed: Also shows where your friends have checked in. 
- [ ] Newsfeed: Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page.
- [ ] Compose Page: User can compose a check in of where they have last eaten.
- [ ] Scroll down to refresh. 

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Find food stores in your area.
- [ ] Implement a bar code scanner. 
- [ ] Implement system to upload/add photos of check in. 
- [ ] System to determine what's hot. 
- [ ] Give users a list of recommended places to check in. 
- [ ] Make profile look nicer. :')

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
